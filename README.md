## Hello

_“Jack of all trades master of none, though oftentimes better than master of one.”_

I'm Joe, and I write code. I work in the lost art of Desktop and Mobile development. I started a company called [BaseWeight](https://baseweight.ai) that specializes in AI development on Mobile and Edge devices.

I also do Engineering Management for my day job where I manage eight software engineers.

I have no idea how this widget arrived at these stats, but I have written a lot of C++ code.  I don't know if it counts Apache Cordova contributions, or if it just counts the code in my local repo, because I've definitely written a lot more Python code than Ruby code at this point in my life.
