## Hello

_“Jack of all trades master of none, though oftentimes better than master of one.”_

I'm Joe, and I write code.  I tend to work on projects and platforms that other people don't seem to want to work on, namely Windows Desktop development, and Android Development.  This tendency has also made it so that I'm basically unemployable in my local job market due to my unique experience not being what employers are looking for.  Therefore, I started a company.

I have no idea how this widget arrived at these stats, but I have written a lot of C++ code.  I don't know if it counts Apache Cordova contributions, or if it just counts the code in my local repo, because I've definitely written a lot more Python code than Ruby code at this point in my life.
