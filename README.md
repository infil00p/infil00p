## Hello

_“Jack of all trades master of none, though oftentimes better than master of one.”_

I'm Joe, and I write code. I work in the lost art of Desktop and Mobile development. I started a company called [BaseWeight](https://baseweight.ai) that specializes in AI development on Mobile and Edge devices.

I also do Engineering Management for my day job where I manage eleven software engineers at a company I will not name here.

I also have a HuggingFace page over [here](https://huggingface.co/infil00p)
